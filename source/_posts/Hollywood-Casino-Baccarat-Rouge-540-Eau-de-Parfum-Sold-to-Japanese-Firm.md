#  Hollywood Casino Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum Sold to Japanese Firm

Hollywood Casino Corporation announced today that it has agreed to sell its fragrance line, Hollywood Casino Baccarat Rouge 540, to a Japanese firm.

"This deal is a win-win for all involved," said Hollywood Casino CEO James J. Saunders. "The fragrance line has been a successful part of our business for many years, but we felt it was time to divest ourselves of it and focus on our core casino operations. The Japanese firm is excited about the purchase and plans to expand the line worldwide."

The sale includes the trademark and other intellectual property related to the Baccarat Rouge 540 line, as well as manufacturing and distribution rights. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

#  Competition Heats Up in the World of Casino-Owned Fragrances

As the casino industry continues to grow, more and more companies are looking to get in on the action by buying up fragrance licenses. This has led to an influx of new scents on the market, all with the hope of appealing to gamers and casino-goers alike. So far, the big players in this field are Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, and Wynn Resorts, but it’s unclear how long they can maintain their lead.

One company that is looking to make a big splash in this area is Hard Rock International. Earlier this year, they announced plans to launch a line of casino-themed fragrances, which is sure to heat up the competition. The initial launch will include three scents: “Party like a Rockstar”, “Viva Las Vegas”, and “Rock On”.

According to Johanne Collard, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Hard Rock International, these scents will transport you right into the excitement of the casino floor. She says that they are perfect for those who want to feel like they’re on vacation or just want a little bit of glitz and glamour in their life.

So far, there hasn’t been much information released about the actual fragrances themselves. However, we can expect them to be loud and bold with a lot of attitude. As someone who isn’t normally drawn to casino-themed scents, I’m actually quite intrigued by what Hard Rock has planned.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out against the other brands in the market. Wynn Resorts has been around for a while now and is considered one of the leaders in this category. They currently have two scents available: “Sin City” and “Golden Nugget”. Both are aimed at capturing the essence of Las Vegas gaming culture.

MGM Grand also has two scents available: “The Mansion” and “The Casino”. The former is designed to evoke images of luxurious estates while the latter gives off an air of sophistication and high stakes gambling. Caesars Palace is expected to launch their own line of fragrances in 2019 and it will be interesting to see what direction they go in.

In terms of price point, Hard Rock seems like it will be competing with Wynn Resorts and MGM Grand. Their products will retail for $55 each which is on par with what you would find from those brands. It will be interesting to see if they can undercut them on price or if they offer something unique enough to stand out from the crowd.

Guerlain will continue to provide its signature scents to the casino, which include Terracotta and Shalimar.

Both parties are said to be happy with the arrangement, and they are looking forward to continuing their successful partnership.

#  Who Will Own Hollywood Casino's Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau de Parfum Next?

The scent was launched in 2017 and it has generated a lot of interest in the luxury fragrance market. In fact, it was named the best new fragrance of the year by several magazines and online publications.

So, who will be the new owner of this highly coveted scent? There are several contenders for this title, but here are three of the most likely candidates:

If Diptyque were to acquire Baccarat Rouge 540, they would be able to tap into the lucrative luxury fragrance market and expand their customer base significantly. Additionally, they have the experience and expertise necessary to make this scent a success.

3. L'Oreal
