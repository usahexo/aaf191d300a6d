# 3. Could New York be the next state to legalize sports betting?

It’s been a little more than a year since the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively legalized sports betting nationwide. The decision has sparked a sports betting “gold rush” as states race to legalize the activity.

To date, 10 states have passed legislation to allow sports betting, while another 11 are in various stages of consideration.

So far, New York has been slow to act, but that may be changing. On July 9, the New York State Gaming Commission held a public meeting to discuss the possibility of legalizing sports betting in the state.

Andres Fernandes, commissioner of the commission, said that they are looking into how they could best implement a sports betting program in the state.

“At this point we’re still exploring what is possible, what makes sense for us in New York and engaging with other stakeholders including our counterparts at the New York State Legislature as well as our colleagues at other states on what they’ve done and how it’s working for them,” Fernandes said.

While there is no timeline for when a decision might be made, it’s clear that New York is considering joining the growing number of states that have legalized sports betting.
