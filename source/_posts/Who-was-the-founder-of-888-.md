#  How do you feel about Arsenal FC? 
Arsenal Football Club, commonly known as Arsenal, is a professional football club based in Islington, London. They compete in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. 

The club has won thirteen First Division and Premier League titles and ten FA Cups. They reached the UEFA Champions League final in 2006. Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893. They entered the inaugural FA Cup in 1887.

Arsenal play their home games at the Emirates Stadium, which they moved into in 2006 after leaving Highbury Stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 60,432 with provisions for expanding to 70,000 should the need arise. Their previous stadium was situated adjacent to Wembley Stadium. 

The current head coach is Unai Emery and the captain is Laurent Koscielny. 

I have been an Arsenal fan since I was a young boy (probably around 7 or 8 years old). My dad was a big fan of the team and so I followed suit. Some of my earliest memories are of watching Arsenal matches with my dad on TV and going to see them play live at Highbury Stadium (before they moved to Emirates Stadium). I have been through highs and lows as an Arsenal fan over the years, but overall I would say that I am very proud to support such a historic club. 

There are many things that I love about supporting Arsenal, but some of my favourites include: their style of play (which is always entertaining to watch), their loyal fanbase (who are some of the most passionate supporters in the world), and their record of success (which is unmatched by any other English club). 

Of course, there are also some downsides to being an Arsenal fan (such as our relatively poor record in recent tournaments such as the Champions League), but overall I would say that it's mostly good times! And long may it continue!

#  What do you think of Maupassant's work? 

Guy de Maupassant is a great author who has written many amazing short stories. I think his work is fantastic, and I really enjoy reading it. His stories are well-written, and they always keep me engaged until the very end. I would highly recommend his work to anyone who enjoys reading short stories.
