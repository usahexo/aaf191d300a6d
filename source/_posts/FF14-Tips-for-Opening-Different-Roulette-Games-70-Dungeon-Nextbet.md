#  Roulette Game 70 Dungeon Nextbet Now Available For All FF14 Players

The popular game, Roulette, is now available for all players of Final Fantasy XIV. The game can be accessed from the Duty Finder under the selection for Casino Games. Players will need to be level 70 and have completed the main scenario quest "????" in order to access it.

In Roulette, players will bet on a random outcome in order to win rewards. There are three different types of bets that can be made: Red or Black, Odd or Even, and 1-18 or 19-36. Rewards vary depending on the type of bet placed, but generally speaking they are quite lucrative.

Roulette is a great way to pass the time and can provide some hefty rewards if played correctly. Be sure to check it out next time you're in the casino!
