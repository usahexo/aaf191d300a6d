#  Gamblers Can Now Ban Themselves From Gambling Online

In a landmark ruling, the UK Court of Appeal has upheld a decision by the UK Gambling Commission to allow online gamblers to ban themselves from gambling online. The ruling overturns an earlier decision by a lower court that ruled that the self-exclusion tool was not effective.

Gambling companies in the UK have been required to offer self-exclusion tools since 2014, but there was no way for customers to enforce the bans themselves. This left many customers feeling like they had no control over their own gambling behavior.

The new ruling allows customers to enforce their own bans, which should give them more confidence in the effectiveness of the tool. Customers who have previously self-excluded themselves from gambling online can now have their bans enforced by the gambling company.

The ruling is a major victory for gambling reform advocates who have been calling for better protection for problem gamblers. Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families.

The self-exclusion tool is one of several measures that are designed to help protect problem gamblers. Other measures include age verification requirements and restrictions on how much money people can spend on gambling each day.

The UK Gambling Commission has been working hard to improve protections for problem gamblers in recent years. In addition to the self-exclusion tool, they have also introduced new rules that require casinos to identify and exclude problem gamblers.

The commission has also introduced new rules that require casinos to identify and exclude problem gamblers. These rules are designed to prevent people with gambling problems from losing even more money at casinos.

Gambling is known as a vice that can be extremely addictive and ruin people financially. Despite this, many people still gamble online, often putting their financial security at risk. If you're one of these people, it's important to take steps to prevent yourself from gambling online. Here are some tips on how to do that:

1. Delete all the gambling-related apps from your phone.

This may seem like an obvious step, but a lot of people still keep gambling apps on their phones, thinking they'll only use them once in a while.

During this time, focus on other things that make you happy and healthy - like spending time with family and friends, going for walks outdoors, or reading books.

4. Disconnect from the internet when you're feeling tempted to gamble online.

If you're feeling tempted to gamble online, disconnect from the internet altogether until the temptation fades away. This way, you won't have any opportunity to give into temptation and will be forced to take some time away from gambling altogether. Disconnecting from the internet can also help if you're having problems with other forms of addiction as well - like sex addiction or excessive gaming habits .
