Could New York be the next state to legalize sports betting?"></a>3. Could New York be the next state to legalize sports betting?</h1><p>It’s been a little more than a year since the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively legalized sports betting nationwide. The decision has sparked a sports betting “gold rush” as states race to legalize the activity.</p>
<p>To date, 10 states have passed legislation to allow sports betting, while another 11 are in various stages of consideration.</p>
<p>So far, New York has been slow to act, but that may be changing. On July 9, the New York State Gaming Commission held a public meeting to discuss the possibility of legalizing sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Andres Fernandes, commissioner of the commission, said that they are looking into how they could best implement a sports betting program in the state.</p>
<p>“At this point we’re still exploring what is possible, what makes sense for us in New York and engaging with other stakeholders including our counterparts at the New York State Legislature as well as our colleagues at other states on what they’ve done and how it’s working for them,” Fernandes said.</p>
<p>While there is no timeline for when a decision might be made, it’s clear that New York is considering joining the growing number of states that have legalized sports betting.</p>

Sports betting coming soon to a casino near you in New York!"></a>4. Sports betting coming soon to a casino near you in New York!</h1><p>The New York State Gaming Commission has given the green light to three casinos in Upstate New York to offer sports betting. The casinos are the del Lago Resort and Casino in Tyre, the Rivers Casino and Resort in Schenectady, and the Tioga Downs Casino Resort in Nichols.</p>
<p>The commission voted unanimously to approve a proposal from the Gaming Facility Location Board that would allow the three casinos to offer sports betting. The vote came after the board recommended that the casinos be allowed to offer sports betting with some conditions.</p>
<p>The commission placed several conditions on the casinos, including that they limit sports betting to locations within their premises, that they not accept bets from people under 21 years old, and that they use geolocation technology to ensure that people are only placing bets within New York State.</p>
<p>Commission chairman John Rhodes said that he was pleased with the unanimous vote by the commission and believes it will be good for the state’s economy. He added that he looks forward to seeing how the casinos can benefit from this new opportunity.</p>
<p>One of the commissioners, Alan Segel, said that he was pleased with how well-regulated the proposal is and believes that it will be a positive addition to the gaming landscape in New York.</p>
<p>The three casinos now have one year to apply for a license from the New York State Gaming Commission to offer sports betting. Once they have obtained a license, they will be able to offer sports betting immediately.</p>
