The $1.5 billion project, dubbed the “Heart of Tinseltown”, has been a hotly contested battleground for electronics giants LG and Samsung.</p>
<p>The amphitheater is a joint venture between the two companies, with each supplying half of the necessary equipment. But as the opening date draws near, it has become clear that only one company can be victorious.</p>
<p>Samsung has long been the dominant player in the consumer electronics market, but LG is determined to wrest away its crown. The Korean company has made a name for itself with its cutting-edge technology and innovative designs, and it is betting that its products will be a hit with moviegoers and concertgoers alike.</p>
<p>Samsung is confident in its own products and believes that its superior quality and service will prevail. It has established an impressive customer support infrastructure, with retail stores throughout Hollywood and a call center that is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Both companies have spared no expense in their battle for supremacy. They have hired top marketing firms and spent millions on advertising campaigns. They have also lavished money on celebrity endorsements, with stars like Scarlett Johansson and Will Smith endorsing both brands.</p>
<p>The new amphitheater is sure to be a huge success, and LG and Samsung are both eager to claim victory in this high-stakes showdown.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 20, 2017, an unknown gambler placed a $10 million bet at the Hollywood casino amphitheater in Tinley Park, Illinois. The wager is thought to be the largest ever placed on a horse race in the United States. If the bet pays off, the anonymous gambler could walk away with a record-breaking payout.</p>
<p>The horse race in question is the Arlington Million, which will take place at Arlington Park Racetrack in Arlington Heights, Illinois on Saturday, August 12, 2017. The Arlington Million is a prestigious race that has been held annually since 1981. The race offers a purse of $1 million, making it one of the richest races in North America.</p>
<p>This year’s field for the Arlington Million includes six horses from three different countries: Canada, Ireland, and the United States. The favorite to win the race is York Harbor, who is currently listed at odds of 3-1. Other notable contenders include Big Blue Kitten (5-1), Beach Patrol (6-1), plus Irish challengers Balto Star (8-1) and Order of Saint George (10-1).</p>
<p>If you’re looking to place a bet on this year’s Arlington Million race, there’s still time to get in on the action. You can place your bets at most online sportsbooks, including Bovada Sportsbook and SportsBettingDime.com.

<p>The intimate theater, which can accommodate up to 10,000 people, features a state-of-the-art sound system and an expansive stage that can accommodate major stars and concerts.</p>
<p>Sources tell ET that the amphitheater is expected to open in early 2020 and will be a major attraction for tourists and locals alike.</p>
<p>“This amphitheater is going to be huge,” said one industry insider. “It’s going to put Hollywood on the map as a must-visit destination for music fans.”</p>

<h1 id="Who-owns-the-new-Hollywood-casino-amphitheater"><a href="#Who-owns-the-new-Hollywood-casino-amphitheater" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the new Hollywood casino amphitheater?"></a>Who owns the new Hollywood casino amphitheater?</h1><p>When the Hollywood Casino Amphitheater opened in Tinley Park, Illinois, just south of Chicago in 1990, it was under the ownership of Miami-based promoter and casino owner Irving Moskowitz.</p>
<p>In 2002, the amphitheater was sold to Live Nation Entertainment as part of a $7 billion merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. At that time, the amphitheater seated 23,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Live Nation Entertainment has since undergone multiple corporate changes. In 2010, it became a subsidiary of concert giant AEG Live. Then, in 2013, AEG Live was acquired by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), a private company owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz.</p>
<p>As of March 2017, the Hollywood Casino Amphitheater is still listed as an owned and operated venue by AEG Live.</p>
