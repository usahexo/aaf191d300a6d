Many different types of crystals are available on the market, but not all of them will work with your specific piece of equipment. Different crystals have different properties that can make them better or worse suited for a particular application.</p>

Particularly with the new, well-known designers coming out with their own collections - like Lalique and Baccarat - it can be difficult to determine whether the piece you are looking at is real or not. However, if you know how to spot the signs of a genuine baccarat Maupassant, then you will never have to worry about being scammed again. </p>
<p>The most important thing to look for when trying to identify a Maupassant baccarat crystal piece is the quality of the cutting.

If these etchings are missing or illegible, then it is likely a fake.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are still unsure whether a piece is authentic or not, there is always the option of taking it to an expert for authentication. But by following these simple tips, you should be able to correctly identify any baccarat Maupassant crystal pieces that you come across.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Identify-a-Baccarat-Maupassant-Crystal"><a href="#How-to-Identify-a-Baccarat-Maupassant-Crystal" class="headerlink" title="How to Identify a Baccarat Maupassant Crystal"></a>How to Identify a Baccarat Maupassant Crystal</h1><p>Baccarat is a company known for quality and craftsmanship in the production of fine crystal. If you are lucky enough to own a piece of Baccarat Maupassant crystal, you will want to know how to identify it. Here are some tips on how to do just that.</p>
<p>The first thing you want to look for is the etched signature of the master glassmaker, Maurice Maupassant. His signature is located on the underside of the crystal stem near the foot. All Baccarat Maupassant pieces are numbered as well. Look for the number “880” which is etched near the signature. This indicates that the piece is part of Baccarat’s Maupassant collection.</p>

The weight should be evenly distributed throughout the piece, and it should feel comfortable in your hand. The shape of the bowl should be symmetrical, with no trace of a pontil mark (the remnant of the glassblower’s pontil rod).</p>
<p>If you are still unsure whether or not your piece is authentic Baccarat Maupassant crystal, there are a few other things you can look for. Pieces from this collection are often decorated with detailed etchings or gold gilding. The quality of the cut is also exceptional, with no sharp edges or uneven surfaces.</p>
<p>If you own a Baccarat Maupassant crystal piece, now you know how to properly identify it! Enjoy your beautiful heirloom knowing that it is truly one-of-a-kind.</p>
