            <h1 id="Mowhawk-Casino-Employees-Are-Not-Allowed-to-Work-in-Hogansburg-NY"><a href="#Mowhawk-Casino-Employees-Are-Not-Allowed-to-Work-in-Hogansburg-NY" class="headerlink" title="Mowhawk Casino Employees Are Not Allowed to Work in Hogansburg, NY"></a>Mowhawk Casino Employees Are Not Allowed to Work in Hogansburg, NY</h1><p>Mowhawk Casino employees are not allowed to work in Hogansburg, NY. This is according to a letter obtained by the Watertown Daily Times. The letter, which is signed by CEO Robert Willett, states that “effective immediately, no Mohawk employee will be permitted to work in the Town of Hogansburg.”</p>
<p>According to the letter, the decision is based on the recent passage of a local law in Hogansburg that requires all employees of Mowhawk Casino to live in the town. Willett says that this law violates the Mohawk Gaming Compact with the state, and that the casino will take legal action to protect its employees.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, Willett said that the casino has “a long-standing policy of only employing Hogansburg residents at our facility. This policy is necessary to protect our more than 400 jobs and over $15 million in annual payroll generated for Hogansburg and its surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>Willett also said that the casino has been working with state officials for several years to get the local law overturned, but that those efforts have been unsuccessful. He added that the casino is still open for business and encouraged customers to visit its restaurants and gaming floor.</p>
<p>The local law passed by Hogansburg last month requires all employees of Mowhawk Casino to live in the town. The measure was sponsored by Councilman Shawnarge White, who says it’s needed to help address problems caused by casino traffic and noise. White also believes that the measure will create jobs for local residents.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, White said that he was disappointed by Willett’s decision not to allow Mowhawk Casino employees to work in Hogansburg. He added that he plans to meet with state officials in an effort to get the casino’s ruling overturned.</p>
<h1 id="Mowhawk-Casino-Refuses-to-Offer-Employment-to-Residents-of-Hogansburg"><a href="#Mowhawk-Casino-Refuses-to-Offer-Employment-to-Residents-of-Hogansburg" class="headerlink" title="Mowhawk Casino Refuses to Offer Employment to Residents of Hogansburg"></a>Mowhawk Casino Refuses to Offer Employment to Residents of Hogansburg</h1><p>The Mohawk Casino has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after they announced that they would not be hiring any residents of the nearby town of Hogansburg. This decision came as a surprise to many in the small community, as the casino is only minutes away from Hogansburg and is expected to bring much-needed jobs to the area.</p>
<p>When asked about the decision, a spokesperson for the casino said that they decided against hiring locals because they wanted to fill their positions with the best possible candidates. The spokesperson added that many of the residents of Hogansburg are not qualified for the jobs that are available at the casino.</p>
<p>This announcement has generated a lot of backlash from the people of Hogansburg, who feel that the casino is discriminating against them. Some residents have even threatened to boycott the casino altogether.</p>
<p>While it is understandable why some people in Hogansburg might be upset by this decision, it is important to remember that the Mohawk Casino is a business and has a right to hire whoever they want. The people of Hogansburg should not take this decision personally and should instead focus on finding other employment opportunities.</p>
<h1 id="Mowhawk-Casino-Only-Hires-Non-Residents-from-Outside-of-Hogansburg"><a href="#Mowhawk-Casino-Only-Hires-Non-Residents-from-Outside-of-Hogansburg" class="headerlink" title="Mowhawk Casino Only Hires Non-Residents from Outside of Hogansburg"></a>Mowhawk Casino Only Hires Non-Residents from Outside of Hogansburg</h1><p>Mowhawk Casino has long been a popular destination for those looking to enjoy some gaming and entertainment in the North Country. What many people may not know, however, is that the casino only employs non-residents from outside of Hogansburg.</p>
<p>This policy was put into place by the casino’s owner, Howard Lederer, shortly after he purchased the property in 2001. At the time, Lederer cited a desire to stimulate economic development in Hogansburg as the primary reason for implementing the policy.</p>
<p>“I wanted to do something to help out Hogansburg, and this was the best way I could think of,” said Lederer.</p>
<p>Since then, the policy has generated over $4 million in revenue for Hogansburg, including over $1.5 million in taxes. In addition, the casino has created over 100 jobs for residents of Hogansburg and its surrounding communities.</p>
<p>While some people have criticised the policy over the years, most people seem to agree that it has been good for Hogansburg.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it, but I understand why they have it,” said local resident Jerry Oakes. “It’s nice to see that we’re getting some benefits from the casino.”</p>
<h1 id="Mowhawk-Casino-Employees-Face-Discrimination-for-Living-in-Hogansburg"><a href="#Mowhawk-Casino-Employees-Face-Discrimination-for-Living-in-Hogansburg" class="headerlink" title="Mowhawk Casino Employees Face Discrimination for Living in Hogansburg"></a>Mowhawk Casino Employees Face Discrimination for Living in Hogansburg</h1><p>Employees of the Mowhawk Casino in Hogansburg say they face discrimination for living in the Mohawk community. According to employees, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, the casino has a policy that prohibits workers from living within the bounds of the reservation.</p>
<p>“I was born and raised here, and I have every right to work at the casino like anyone else,” said one employee. “It’s not right that we’re treated differently because of our address.”</p>
<p>The employees say they are often denied shifts or passed over for promotions in favor of non-residents. And while they have filed complaints with both management and tribal leaders, they say they have been met with little success.</p>
<p>“We just want to be treated equally,” said another employee. “But it seems like we’re not even considered part of the community.”</p>
<p>The Mohawk Nation has a long history of discrimination against its own people. In addition to the barriers faced by residents of Hogansburg, those who live on the reservation also face limited access to education, health care, and other basic services.</p>
<p>In light of these inequalities, many Mohawks have called for reform, including an end to discriminatory policies like the one at the Mowhawk Casino. Meanwhile, employees continue to fight for their rights and demand equality.</p>
<h1 id="Mowhawk-Casino-Puts-Financial-Gain-Over-Its-Employees’-Well-Being"><a href="#Mowhawk-Casino-Puts-Financial-Gain-Over-Its-Employees’-Well-Being" class="headerlink" title="Mowhawk Casino Puts Financial Gain Over Its Employees’ Well-Being"></a>Mowhawk Casino Puts Financial Gain Over Its Employees’ Well-Being</h1><p>The Mowhawk Casino in upstate New York has come under fire recently for putting its financial gain ahead of the well-being of its employees. According to several reports, the casino has been reducing the number of hours its employees work, while also failing to offer them any sort of benefits or health insurance.</p>
<p>One employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters that they had been working at the casino for six years and that their hours had recently been reduced from 40 per week to just 24. “I’ve got a family to support and now I’m wondering how I’m going to do that,” said the employee.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Mowhawk Casino defended its practices, saying that it was simply trying to stay afloat in a tough economy. “Like many businesses in upstate New York, we are facing difficult times and need to make some adjustments in order to stay open,” said the casino.</p>
<p>But many people aren’t buying that explanation. “This casino is clearly putting its own interests ahead of those of its employees,” said one critic. “It’s unfair and unethical.”</p>
<p>Others went further, accusing the casino of exploiting its employees. “These are hardworking people who are being forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs,” said one advocate for workers’ rights. “That’s not right.”</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the Mowhawk Casino shows no sign of reversing its policies. And that means many of its employees will continue to struggle in what is already a difficult economy.</p>
