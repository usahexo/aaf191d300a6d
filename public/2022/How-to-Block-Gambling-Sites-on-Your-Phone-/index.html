If you’re worried about someone in your life becoming addicted to gambling, or if you’re struggling with an addiction yourself, blocking gambling websites on your phone can be a helpful step.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to block gambling sites on your phone. One way is to use a built-in feature of your phone’s operating system. For example, on Android devices you can use the parental controls to block specific websites. Another way is to install an app that blocks websites. There are several different apps available that do this, such as Net Nanny and Covenant Eyes.</p>
<p>If you’re using an Android device, there are a few things you need to do before you can start blocking gambling sites:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Settings menu and select “Parental Controls”.</li>
<li>Make sure the switch at the top of the screen is turned on.</li>
<li>If this is your first time using Parental Controls, you will be prompted to create a new user profile. </li>
<li>After creating the new profile, select it from the list of profiles and then select “Apps &amp; Games” from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen. </li>
<li>In the “Allowed content” section, make sure that “Gambling sites” is set to “Blocked”.</li>
<li>You can also choose to block other types of content, such as pornography or social media apps. </li>
<li>Exit out of Settings and open up your web browser. You should now see a message telling you that Parental Controls are enabled and that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gamblingaddictionhelp.org/">www.gamblingaddictionhelp.org</a> has been blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to unblock a website, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gamblingaddictionhelp.org/">www.gamblingaddictionhelp.org</a>, open up Settings and select “Parental Controls” from the list of options. Then select the profile that contains the website you want to unblock and toggle the switch next to “Gambling sites” from “Blocked” to “Allowed”</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Keep-Yourself-from-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Keep-Yourself-from-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Keep Yourself from Gambling"></a>How to Keep Yourself from Gambling</h1><p>Gambling can be an enjoyable, recreational activity for some people. However, for others it can become a harmful addiction. If you’re worried that you might have a gambling problem, or if you’ve already recognized that you do have a problem, there are steps you can take to help yourself.</p>
<p>The first step is to admit that you have a problem and to be honest with yourself about the extent of your gambling. Many people try to downplay or deny their addiction, but this won’t do anything to help solve the problem. Recognize that gambling is causing problems in your life –- financial problems, relationship problems, etc. – and be willing to address these issues.</p>
<p>The second step is to make a commitment to stop gambling. This may sounds difficult, but it’s important to remember that overcoming an addiction is not easy and takes time and effort. It’s also important to make sure that you have the support of family and friends as you work on overcoming your problem.</p>
<p>The third step is to develop a plan for dealing with urges to gamble. When you experience an urge to gamble, recognize it for what it is and immediately take action to counter it. Some tips for dealing with urges include: avoiding situations where gambling is available; distracting yourself with other activities; postponing any decision about gambling until later; and talking to someone else about your urge.(1)</p>
<p>The fourth step is to practice self-care. Gambling can be stressful, so it’s important to take time for yourself and relax regularly. Practices like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can help reduce stress levels and promote relaxation. It’s also important to eat healthy foods and get enough sleep.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t give up if things get tough. Overcoming an addiction is not easy, but it is possible. With patience and perseverance, you can overcome your gambling problem and reclaim your life.(2)</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Stop-Yourself-from-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Stop-Yourself-from-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Stop Yourself from Gambling"></a>How to Stop Yourself from Gambling</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but for some people it can become an addiction that ruins their lives. If you find yourself struggling to stop gambling, here are a few tips that can help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be honest with yourself about how much you’re gambling and how it’s affecting your life.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re unable to control your gambling habits, then it’s time to admit that you have a problem. Don’t try to downplay the extent of your addiction or make excuses for your behavior. Own up to the fact that you have a problem and need to take action to address it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Seek professional help.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many addiction treatment programs available that can help you overcome your gambling addiction. Talk to your doctor or consult a trusted counselor about getting help.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Avoid temptation by staying away from casinos, online gambling sites, and other places where gambling takes place.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t resist the temptation to gamble, then stay away from all places where you might be tempted to do so. This includes casinos, online gambling sites, and even lottery tickets stores. If these places are off limits for you, then it will be much harder to give in to the temptation of gambling again and again.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make a plan for what you will do instead of gambling when boredom or stress strikes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you tend to gamble when you’re bored or stressed out, then have a plan in place for what you will do instead of gambling. This could include things like taking a walk, reading a book, watching a movie, or spending time with friends and family members. By having a backup plan ready to go, you can prevent yourself from turning to gambling as a way to cope with difficult situations.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Replace unhealthy thoughts and behaviors with healthy ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to overcome an addiction like gambling, it’s important to replace unhealthy thoughts and behaviors with healthy ones. This means replacing thoughts like “I need to gamble because I’m bored” with thoughts like “I could go for a walk or read a book instead” and replacing behaviors like “gambling is the only thing that makes me happy” with behaviors like “eating healthy and exercising makes me feel good mentally and physically.” When unhealthy thoughts and behaviors are replaced with healthy ones, it becomes easier to stay on track with recovery from an addiction like gambling</p>
<h1 id="How-can-I-stop-myself-from-gambling"><a href="#How-can-I-stop-myself-from-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How can I stop myself from gambling?"></a>How can I stop myself from gambling?</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting experience, but for some people it can become a serious problem. If you find yourself struggling to resist the urge to gamble, here are four tips that can help you stay in control:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set limits and stick to them</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to stay in control when gambling is to set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you’re going to gamble with and when you’re going to stop playing. Make sure these limits are realistic and achievable, so you’re not putting yourself under too much pressure.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Avoid temptation</li>
</ol>
<p>If possible, avoid betting or gaming venues altogether. If this isn’t possible, try to limit your exposure to temptation by avoiding the high-risk areas of the casino or betting shop. If there’s anything that tempts you to gamble more than you intended, remove it from your environment altogether. This could include removing credit cards or banknotes from your wallet, quitting gambling websites or shutting down your gambling account.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Get help if needed</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find it difficult to resist the urge to gamble, it may be helpful to seek professional help. There are many organisations that offer support and treatment for people with gambling addiction, so don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>be aware of the warning signs</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re worried that you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, be aware of the warning signs: secrecy around money, borrowing money from friends or family members, frequently losing money gambling, feeling anxious or stressed when not gambling, hiding gambling activities from others etc. If you notice any of these signs in yourself or someone else, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-block-gambling-sites-on-your-Android"><a href="#How-to-block-gambling-sites-on-your-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to block gambling sites on your Android"></a>How to block gambling sites on your Android</h1><p>It’s no secret that online gambling is a billion-dollar industry. People of all ages can be found gambling on the internet, but do you know that it’s also possible to block gambling sites on Android? In this guide, we will show you how to do just that!</p>
<p>There are several methods for blocking gambling sites on Android. In this article, we will cover two of the most popular methods: using a VPN and using a browser extension. Let’s start with the VPN method.</p>
<h1 id="Method-1-Using-a-VPN"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a VPN"></a>Method 1: Using a VPN</h1><p>A VPN (virtual private network) is a service that allows you to connect to the internet via a server run by a third party. This server acts as a middleman between you and the websites you visit, effectively hiding your identity and location.</p>
<p>VPNs are an excellent way to block gambling sites on Android, as they can be used to hide your IP address from websites. This means that even if you try to visit a gambling site, the site will be unable to determine where you are located and will not be able to load properly.</p>
<p>There are many different VPN services available, but we recommend ExpressVPN . It is one of the most popular VPN services in the world and it has servers in over 90 countries, including Australia. It also has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it out risk free.</p>
<p>To use ExpressVPN on Android, simply download the app from the Google Play Store and sign up for an account. Once you have registered for an account, open the app and select the “connect” button. The app will then connect to the nearest ExpressVPN server.</p>
<p>Now that your VPN is connected, let’s take a look at how to block gambling sites on Android using it. First, open your web browser and navigate to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.expressvpn.com/features/android-vpn/">https://www.expressvpn.com/features/android-vpn/</a>. Scroll down until you see the section titled “How to block websites on Android” and click on the link below it entitled “Learn more”.</p>
<p>   The next page will explain how to configure your VPN settings in order to block gambling sites on Android. Simply follow the instructions listed and make sure that “Block all unencrypted traffic” is selected as shown in the screenshot below: Once you have finished configuring your settings, click on the “OK” button at the bottom of the page. Your VPN will now be configured to block gambling sites on Android! If you want to check that everything is working correctly, try visiting a gambling site – you should see an error message stating that the site cannot be loaded due to your location being blocked. That’s all there is to it! Using a VPN is an easy way to protect yourself from online gambling threats while keeping your identity hidden.</p>
