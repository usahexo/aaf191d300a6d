            <h1 id="Orioles-Favored-In-Series-Opener-With-Detroit-Tigers"><a href="#Orioles-Favored-In-Series-Opener-With-Detroit-Tigers" class="headerlink" title="Orioles Favored In Series Opener With Detroit Tigers"></a>Orioles Favored In Series Opener With Detroit Tigers</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles will open up a three-game series against the Detroit Tigers on Monday night.</p>
<p>Baltimore comes into the series opener as the favorites, as they are -145 home favorites, per OddsShark. The Orioles have had a successful season to this point, as they currently hold a 38-27 record and sit in first place in the American League East.</p>
<p>Detroit, on the other hand, has had a disappointing season thus far. The Tigers currently hold a 28-36 record and are in fourth place in the AL Central.</p>
<p>Baltimore has been led offensively by Manny Machado this season. The third baseman is hitting .314 with 18 home runs and 50 RBIs on the year. Chris Davis has also been solid for the Orioles, hitting .272 with 16 home runs and 47 RBIs.</p>
<p>Detroit’s offense has been led by Miguel Cabrera this season. The slugger is hitting .338 with 14 home runs and 54 RBIs. Justin Upton has also had a good season for Detroit, hitting .281 with 16 home runs and 58 RBIs.</p>
<p>The pitching matchup for Monday’s game will be Detroit’s Jordan Zimmermann vs. Baltimore’s Kevin Gausman. Zimmermann is 4-3 with a 4.20 ERA this season, while Gausman is 3-5 with a 4.85 ERA.</p>
<p>Zimmermann will be looking to get back on track after giving up six runs in his last start against the Texas Rangers. Gausman, meanwhile, will be looking to bounce back from an outing in which he allowed four runs in six innings against the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<h1 id="Nelson-Cruz-Returns-To-Baltimore-What-Does-It-Mean-For-The-Orioles’-Odds"><a href="#Nelson-Cruz-Returns-To-Baltimore-What-Does-It-Mean-For-The-Orioles’-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Nelson Cruz Returns To Baltimore - What Does It Mean For The Orioles’ Odds?"></a>Nelson Cruz Returns To Baltimore - What Does It Mean For The Orioles’ Odds?</h1><p>Nelson Cruz is the biggest name to change teams so far in this offseason’s free agent market, and he has finally made his decision: he is returning to the Baltimore Orioles on a four-year, $58 million deal.</p>
<p>Cruz was one of the most feared hitters in baseball during his three seasons in Baltimore, averaging 39 home runs and 107 RBIs per season. He was also a key part of the team’s run to the 2014 AL Championship Series.</p>
<p>With Cruz back in Baltimore, the Orioles are now favorites to win the American League East. They had already been one of the top teams in the division, but with Cruz added to an already potent lineup, they are even more of a threat.</p>
<p>The addition of Cruz also solidifies the Orioles’ roster heading into spring training. They now have an imposing lineup that includes Chris Davis, Manny Machado, Jonathan Schoop, and Adam Jones, among others.</p>
<p>This gives them plenty of depth and allows them to mix and match depending on who is hot on any given day. This could be especially important if they find themselves in a tight playoff race down the stretch.</p>
<p>Cruz will also give Orioles manager Buck Showalter another weapon off the bench should he need it late in games.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great move by Baltimore. They have added another elite player to an already dangerous lineup while not sacrificing any future prospects. And at just $58 million over four years, it’s also a very affordable deal for such a big bat.</p>
<h1 id="Manny-Machado-Listed-As-Heavy-Favorite-To-Win-AL-MVP"><a href="#Manny-Machado-Listed-As-Heavy-Favorite-To-Win-AL-MVP" class="headerlink" title="Manny Machado Listed As Heavy Favorite To Win AL MVP"></a>Manny Machado Listed As Heavy Favorite To Win AL MVP</h1><p>If you would’ve asked anyone who the favorite to win the AL MVP award was at the beginning of the season, Manny Machado would’ve been the unanimous answer. And with good reason – Machado is having an MVP-caliber season, leading the Baltimore Orioles to a surprising first-place finish in the AL East.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Machado is listed as such a heavy favorite to win the MVP award. He leads all of baseball in WAR (wins above replacement), and is in the top three in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. His numbers are even more impressive when you consider that he plays shortstop, one of the most demanding positions on defense.</p>
<p>There are several other players who could make a case for MVP honors this year, including Mike Trout of the Angels and Josh Donaldson of the Blue Jays. But Machado has been so dominant this season that it would be tough to argue against him winning his first MVP award.</p>
<h1 id="Buck-Showalter-Orioles-Agree-To-New-Deal"><a href="#Buck-Showalter-Orioles-Agree-To-New-Deal" class="headerlink" title="Buck Showalter, Orioles Agree To New Deal"></a>Buck Showalter, Orioles Agree To New Deal</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>After months of negotiations, Buck Showalter and the Baltimore Orioles have agreed to a new deal. The long-time manager will be staying in Baltimore for at least the next three years.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Showalter has been with the Orioles since 2010, and has led them to three postseason appearances. This year, they finished 89-73 and just missed out on the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Both sides are obviously happy with the new deal. “Buck is an incredible manager and leader, and we are fortunate to have him,” said Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette. “He has consistently delivered winning seasons and playoff appearances for the Orioles, and we are excited about his future with our organization.”</p>
<h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>“I’m really happy to be able to stay here,” said Showalter. “Baltimore is my home, and I love this organization. We have a lot of unfinished business, and I can’t wait to get started.”</p>
<h1 id="World-Series-Odds-Baltimore-Orioles-33-1"><a href="#World-Series-Odds-Baltimore-Orioles-33-1" class="headerlink" title="World Series Odds: Baltimore Orioles 33-1"></a>World Series Odds: Baltimore Orioles 33-1</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles were one of the most surprising teams in baseball this season. After finishing at the bottom of the AL East in 2016, they made a miraculous turnaround and won the division this year. They boast one of the most powerful lineups in baseball, with sluggers like Manny Machado, Chris Davis and Adam Jones leading the way. However, their pitching staff is still a major question mark.</p>
<p>The Orioles are not considered serious contenders to win the World Series this year. Their odds are currently 33-1, which puts them behind teams like the Dodgers (5-1), Astros (7-1) and Cubs (8-1). If they can get some consistent performances from their starting pitchers, they could be a dark horse candidate to make a run at the title. But it’s more likely that they will end up falling short again this year.</p>
